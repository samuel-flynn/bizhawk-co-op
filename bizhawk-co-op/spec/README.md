# Specs

## What is this folder?

This is the folder that contains [busted test specs](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/#overview).

## How do I run these?

You have to [install busted](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/#usage) first, which also requires `luarocks`.

Once you've installed `luarocks`, use the command
```
luarocks install busted
```
to install busted.

Finally, you can run
```
busted bizhawk-co-op
```
to run the tests.
